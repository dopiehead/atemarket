<b>Ad title</b><br>

<div style="font-family:poppins;">

<br><br><b>Ad description</b><br>

Your ad description should describe what is being advertised. It should not be copied from other advertisers (this is illegal under copyright laws). It should also not contain unnecessary search words, offensive remarks, or links to other auction/classifieds/marketplace sites. Unnecessary search words are words that do not directly refer to the item itself, but rather refer to closely related items. For example, ads for Nike shoes should not contain the words "Adidas", "Reebok", or "Puma".


<br><br><b>Ad language</b><br>

Only ads in English is allowed.


<br><br><b>Ad category</b><br>

You should place your ad in the category that best describes what is being advertised.


<br><br><b>No multiple items in 1 ad</b><br>

You should only advertise 1 unique item in each ad.


<br><br><b>No duplicates</b><br>

You should not place the same ad more than once. If you wish to advertise the same item again, please delete your previous ad before you insert a new ad of the same item. Posting the same ad using a different name or email is also not allowed.


<br><br><b>Links</b><br>

You can place links that are relevant to your ad in the ad text description. However, you cannot place links to another auction, classifieds, or marketplace site.


<br><br><p><b>Images</b><br>

You should add images that are relevant to your ad. Company logos should not be used as images except for the "Services", "Jobs" and "Businesses for Sale" categories.

An image is not suitable if it:
Was taken by another advertiser, and is being reused without their consent (this is illegal under copyright laws)
Contains contact details (phone, email, links, Facebook, or any other personal info)

Contains promotional words
Contains an advertiser's own watermark of contact details and price

<br><br><b>Realistic offers</b><br>

You should provide the actual selling price of your item in your ad, except for ads under the "Jobs" category.  www.atemarket.com reserves the right to refuse unrealistic selling prices which we do not think are the actual full price of your item (strictly no instalments, down-payments or trade-in prices).


<br><br><p><b>Bidding and auctions</b><br>

We do not accept any ads related to auction or bidding. We only accept ads with actual prices.</p>
